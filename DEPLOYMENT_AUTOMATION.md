# 🚀 Railway Deployment - Quick Start

## ⚡ One-Click Deploy (Fastest)

### Step 1: Link Repository to Railway
```bash
# Visit: https://railway.app/dashboard
# Click "Create New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub"
# Select: Avonce901/bank-platform
# Branch: copilot/devfixdeploy
```

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables
Once project is created in Railway dashboard:

1. Go to **Variables** tab
2. Add these variables:

```
DEBUG = False
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY = django-insecure-your-secret-key-here
ALLOWED_HOSTS = *.railway.app
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = pk_live_[your-live-public-key]
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = sk_live_[your-live-secret-key]
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = whsec_live_[your-webhook-secret]
```

3. **Save** - Railway auto-deploys (2-3 minutes)

## 🤖 Automated Deployment (Local)

### Using Python Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Verify everything is ready
python railway-deploy.py
```

Output shows:
- ✅ Prerequisites verified
- ✅ GitHub auth confirmed
- ✅ Branch synced to remote
- 📋 Deployment instructions

### Using Bash Script
```bash
# Requires railway CLI installed
./railway-deploy.sh
```

## 🔄 GitHub Actions Auto-Deploy

Once configured, every push to `copilot/devfixdeploy` triggers:

1. ✅ Code pushed to GitHub
2. 🚀 GitHub Actions workflow runs
3. 📋 Railway detects new commits
4. 🔄 Auto-redeploy begins
5. ⏳ ~5 minutes to production

### To Enable Auto-Deploy:
1. Go to your GitHub repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Click **New repository secret**
3. Name: `RAILWAY_TOKEN`
4. Value: Get from https://railway.app/dashboard → Account → Tokens
5. Save
