# ⚡ QUICK: Add Variables to Railway (2 minutes)

## Step 1: Go to Railway Dashboard
🔗 https://railway.app/dashboard

---

## Step 2: Select Your Project
Click on **"beneficial-heart"** (or your project name)

---

## Step 3: Open Variables Tab

Look for the tabs at the top. Click on **"Variables"** 
(Alternative: Settings → Variables)

---

## Step 4: Add Three Variables

### Variable #1
**Name:** `DEPLOYMENT_MODE`  
**Value:** `production`  
Click ✅ Save

### Variable #2
**Name:** `STRIPE_API_KEY`  
**Value:** `sk_live_` (paste your full secret key from Stripe)  
Click ✅ Save

**Where to find it:**
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com/
2. Click **"Developers"** (left sidebar)
3. Click **"API Keys"**
4. Under **"Secret key"**, click the eye icon to reveal
5. Click copy (it starts with `sk_live_`)
6. Paste into Railway

### Variable #3
**Name:** `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`  
**Value:** `whsec_live_` (paste your full webhook secret from Stripe)  
Click ✅ Save

**Where to find it:**
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com/
2. Click **"Developers"** → **"Webhooks"**
3. Click on your webhook endpoint (the URL you saved earlier)
4. Scroll down to **"Signing secret"**
5. Click the eye icon to reveal
6. Click copy (it starts with `whsec_live_`)
7. Paste into Railway

## Step 5: Railway Auto-Redeploys

Once all three variables are saved:
- ✅ Railway detects changes
- ✅ Railway automatically rebuilds (takes 2-3 minutes)
- ✅ Watch the "Deployments" tab for the progress bar

---

## Step 6: Verify It's Live

Once Railway shows ✅ green checkmark on the deployment:

```bash
python check_railway_readiness.py
```

Should show: **7/7 items ready** ✅

---

## What Happens After Deploy

1. Production mode **ACTIVATED** 🎯
2. Stripe **LIVE MODE** enabled 💳
3. All financial transactions **REAL** 💰
4. Bill.com, Plaid, Intuit integrations **ACTIVE** 📊

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **sk_live_*** = Real money Secret Key (keep private!)
- **whsec_live_*** = Webhook signing secret (used for Stripe verification)
- Once added, you cannot view these keys again in Railway (only at Stripe)
- If you lose a key, generate a new one at Stripe and update Railway
